Durban - The Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities (DWYPD) in partnership with the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government, and various government entities will launch Women’s Month 2022 on Monday in Durban. The launch event will take place at the Olive Convention Centre in Durban.  Women’s Month will be launched under the theme: “Women’s Socio-Economic Rights and Empowerment: Building Back Better for Women’s Resilience!” The department said this year’s Women’s Month is a call to action to all of society, government, and partners to take tangible steps forward in responding to the most persistent challenges affecting the lives of women and girls. This year marks the 66th anniversary since the march of close to 20 000 women to the Union Buildings to petition against the pass laws of the country at the time. The department said the National Women’s Month programme is based on the ongoing interventions across the work of government, civil society, and the private sector within the context of the national priorities outlined by government. The Women’s Month launch event will include a full day workshop on Waste Management: identifying economic opportunities in the waste sector value chains for women, youth, and persons with disabilities.  “The workshop espouses the theme for the month which looks at breaking barriers to access in industries dominated by men,” the department said. Minister in the Presidency for Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, will deliver the keynote address. The department said the workshop will focus on awareness-raising on economic opportunities for women, youth, and persons with disabilities in the waste management sector, including through the value chains in the management of waste material and reprocessing/recycling into new products. The National Women’s Day event will also take place in KwaZulu-Natal at Richmond Local Municipality. THE MERCURY
