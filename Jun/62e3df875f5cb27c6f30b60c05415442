Durban — The uMhlathuze municipality has warned about a fake Facebook page and WhatsApp number used to con people, purported to be mayor Xolani Ngwezi. The municipality said that the Facebook page was created using the mayor’s name as “Xolane Mashimane Ifp”. “The culprit is pretending to be mayor Ngwezi and is privately messaging and asking people to deposit some money,” the municipality said. “The mayor would like to distance himself from this fake Facebook page and WhatsApp number used to con the people.” In February, eThekwini municipality deputy mayor Philani Mavundla said there was a person on Facebook who goes by the name Philani Mavundla who posted cleaning job opportunities, adding that the person used his name in his profile to look like he is Mavundla, the deputy mayor. “People please be extra careful, there is a bogus Philani Mavundla on Facebook claiming all sorts of things in my name.  “This is not my account and I have since notified all city officials including law-enforcement agencies to deal with this person and his/ her criminal acts.  “I only have one Facebook account/page that exists and only 1 Instagram account.  “I would never advertise any city jobs or opportunities through these media platforms - in actual fact, that is not how we operate in the municipality.  “Please refrain from engaging with this criminal using my name in a dirty manner,” read the deputy mayor’s post. On Facebook, Mavundla goes by the name councillor PG Mavundla.  He uses this page to communicate the work he is doing for eThekwini residents as chair of the human settlement and infrastructure committee.  His portfolio includes water and sanitation as well as refuse collection. Daily News
