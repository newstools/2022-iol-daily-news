Durban — The Durban High Court is set to hear the trial of a 28-year-old man who went on a two-day rampage allegedly trying to kill fellow criminals, claiming they had stolen an illegal firearm he had allegedly only lent to them. Sizwe Chris Macingwane, who is in custody, faces three counts of attempted murder, with one of the victims being a child, and one charge of murder. The trial will run from August 22 to September 28 after the bloody attacks. It is alleged that on or about February 28, 2021, at or near the Amoati area, the accused attempted to kill Simphiwe Khanyile, wounding him. On the same day, the State alleges, Macingwane also attempted to kill Bongani Khanyile, by wounding him with a firearm. He is also alleged to have attempted to kill Yamkela Cele, a minor child. “The offence involved an assault where a dangerous wound was inflicted with a firearm...” Macingwane is also charged with murder in that on March 3 at or near Amaoti he allegedly killed Vusi Myeza, an adult man. The State alleges that Macingwane and the victims were known to each other as residents of Amaotana in Inanda. “The accused believed that the victims in counts 1, 2 and 4 had stolen his illegal firearms. “The accused decided to shoot and kill the victims. “During the evening of February 28, 2021, the accused went in search of the victims and found them in a house at Amaoti, Inanda.” At the house, the State says, Macingwane allegedly shot Bongani and Simphiwe Khanyile. On the morning of March 3, 2021, the accused armed himself and went in search of Myeza whom he found at the Inanda Taxi Rank. “The accused chased the victim, shot and killed him. A child who was a bystander was also hit and wounded.” The State said the cause of death of Myeza was later established as “gunshot wounds to the head”. The State alleged that Myeza’s death was premeditated. Daily News
