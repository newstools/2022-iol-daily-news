Durban — East Coast Radio was recognised for its successful KZN Flood Relief campaign in partnership with Gift of the Givers. They were awarded the Community and Social Responsibility award at Standard Bank’s 16th edition of KZN Top Business Awards, which were held at the Radisson Blu Hotel in uMhlanga on Wednesday. The award recognises the station’s commitment to the people of KwaZulu-Natal, especially after all the hardships KZN has been through. ECR’s main intention was to help KZN rebuild and be a better place for all after the devastating floods. The campaign generated more than R6.7 million in donations to help the province’s flood victims, and with the help of Gift of the Givers, the funds were used to rebuild schools and homes, buy school uniforms, books and more for the affected communities. East Coast Radio’s managing director, Boni Mchunu, was happy that the station won the award, saying it showed ECR’s dedication to serving the community. “KZN is the home of ECR, and we are delighted to have the opportunity to be able to use our voices to assist and uplift KZN communities. Our promise is to continue making an impact and serve KZN always because as a brand, we believe that together, we can build a united province that is known for the warmth of its people, diverse culture and the spirit of ubuntu,” Mchunu said. She said ECR was committed to assisting and supporting KZN communities through its The Big Favour weekly feature. “This is not where we are stopping; we are determined to change lives and see smiles on people’s faces.” Daily News
