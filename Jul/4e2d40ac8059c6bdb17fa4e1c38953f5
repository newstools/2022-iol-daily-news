Durban — Tributes are pouring in for the head of the Dusi Canoe Marathon organising committee, Cameron Mackenzie, who died of cancer on Wednesday. Those close to him remembered a man committed to growing paddling and the Dusi Canoe Marathon, said chairperson of the KwaZulu-Natal Canoe Club Doug Gow. He said Mackenzie spent 17 years at the helm of the Dusi Canoe Marathon and would be sorely missed.  “It’s devastating to lose such a prominent figure in canoeing. We extend our deepest sympathies to Cameron’s family and friends.” Mackenzie did not only facilitate the Dusi Canoe Marathon as an event for over 15 years, he completed the three-day race nine times as a paddler. He was the founder, inspiration and guiding hand behind Parklane SuperSpar. In a tribute, the company said his “unwavering passion for retail and his endless generosity will be sorely missed”. Pietermaritzburg resident Lara Edmonds said in a tribute on Facebook that Pietermaritzburg had lost a great man – “kind and extremely generous”. “We personally were on the receiving end of Cameron’s compassionate generosity during our little son's journey with cancer – he donated a brand new canoe for a fund-raising raffle for the Baby James Fund. This gave us so much hope at a very dark time. I suspect Cameron contributed to many causes quietly without fanfare! “Talking fanfare, PMB is indebted to Cameron for his sponsorship of the KZN Philharmonic at numerous concerts. We loved the Royal Symphony Concerts at Royal Show South Africa – they brought so much joy to PMB. “Thank you Cameron and our favourite, Parklane Spar, for your investment in people and PMB.” Daily News
