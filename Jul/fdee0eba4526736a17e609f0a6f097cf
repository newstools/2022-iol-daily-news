Durban — Despite his last-minute withdrawal for ANC chairperson in the KwaZulu-Natal conference in anticipation of defeat, businessman Sandile Zungu has vowed to stay in politics. The AmaZulu Football Club owner will form part of the delegation at the ANC's national policy conference which begins on Friday and ends on Sunday in Johannesburg. He was invited by the new provincial leadership to form part of its delegation.  Speaking to the Daily News on Wednesday, already in Gauteng, the uMlazi-born businessman said that despite not getting the position he wanted in the province, he would stay close and help the new leadership he was running against, saying he was honoured by their unexpected invitation. "It was a great gesture to be invited by the new provincial leadership so I will stay close to them and help them to be better. I pledge my support for the new leadership and am prepared to work with them and help them throughout," said Zungu. After mounting a strong campaign, criss-crossing the province gunning for votes for the all-powerful chairperson position, he surprised many when he declined the nomination at the last minute after he was nominated from the floor at the conference in Durban last week. It was after he failed to get 20% of branch nominations which is a requirement for one to be on the ballot. He had needed 177 branch nominations. From the floor nominations, he needed 25% or 402 delegates in order to qualify for the contest, but seeing that the numbers were not on his side, Zungu declined to the loud applause from the 1 600 delegates at the Olive Convention Centre.
