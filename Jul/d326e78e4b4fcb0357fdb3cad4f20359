Durban — House of Arushka, a brand that showcases local talent, will hold its first charity pink lunch on August 9 at the Radisson BLU Hotel in uMhlanga. Part of the proceeds of the event will be donated to the Cancer Association of South Africa (Cansa). Having lost several people to cancer, Arushka Naidoo, the founder of the organisation, felt this was the proper way to give back. The pink lunch will be a memorial to all those who fought a good fight with cancer but lost, she said. Naidoo also said that it would honour people who were fighting the battle privately. “Many people are suffering from cancer without anyone knowing. They are fighting a silent battle. We will not only honour and remember cancer victims, but we also aim to create awareness and show people battling with cancer that they are not alone. We are with them,” she said. Naidoo said they planned the event to coincide with Women’s Day because mostly women battled cancer, even though the disease affected anyone. Cansa KZN sustainability co-ordinator Lloyd Dlamini expressed his gratitude to the House of Arushka’s initiative. “Such initiatives make a big difference in the organisation because that means we get to continue helping people fight cancer, and also educate and support communities by teaching them a healthy lifestyle so they can live longer,” he said. Dlamini said he wished more people would get involved. “This awareness is going to change the lives of people battling cancer. I wish people could keep supporting such a movement,” he added. Many well-known personalities are expected to attend. The guest of honour will be television personality, philanthropist and businesswoman Sorisha Naidoo. Since the organisation helps promote local issues, people will be allowed to advertise and showcase their businesses to the guests. There will be lots of prizes, giveaways and exciting entertainment.
