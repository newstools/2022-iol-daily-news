Durban — A man charged with the murder of a woman, who intervened when he and his girlfriend were having an altercation, is expected to appear again in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court next month. Nqobile Nzimande, 26, is alleged to have killed Nozipho Ndokweni in Nazareth on February 5. He made his first court appearance three days later. It is alleged that Ndokweni hit Nzimande on the head with a beer bottle. He allegedly chased her, caught her and then stabbed her to death. Nzimande then ran to his uncle’s house in Nazareth. In court on Tuesday, the State asked that the matter be adjourned for further investigation. Acting magistrate Mkhize granted the request and Legal Aid defence attorney KS Nxele asked the court to mark it as the final adjournment. In March, Nzimande applied for bail but was refused. He told the court he had three children, aged 6, 4 and one. He said he intended to plead not guilty. He had been employed as a packer at a supermarket in Pinetown. Previously, the court heard from the investigating officer, Sifiso Mbambo, who said he was opposed to bail. He said Nzimande posed a danger to society and to the witnesses who were known to him.
