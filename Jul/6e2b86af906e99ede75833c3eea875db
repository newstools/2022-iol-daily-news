Durban — Twitter users had a lot to say after the DA in KwaZulu-Natal congratulated newly elected ANC KZN chairperson Siboniso Duma in a tweet on Sunday. DA KZN said: “Congratulations to the next leader of the opposition of KwaZulu-Natal in 2024.” The party also posted an image of Duma with the same words “Congratulations to the next leader of the opposition of KwaZulu-Natal in 2024!” Congratulations to the next leader of the opposition of KwaZulu-Natal in 2024. pic.twitter.com/tdlbsiAPTJ Tweeps reacted differently to the post. Some were left surprised by the DA’s audacity to even say something regarding the ANC KZN elective conference. Others commented on the DA’s caption on congratulating the next leader of the opposition of KZN in 2024, hinting that the DA would be the ruling party in the province. *SMH* Extreme poor taste. Defies the traditions of liberalism. Have the maturity to extend a congratulatory hand to an #ANCKZN leadership that has emerged from an open, democratic contest.  This will end in premium tears  @DA-KZN you're very brave and misinformed to to think you're going to lead KZN  The DA need to know that its Sunday and on Sundays nobody tell lies.  Can some remind them that they did not even score 30% in the last elections in KZN  They know it, they just campaigning for publicity. ANC will lead KZN.  They will not rule KZN but IFP will do that The demise of the ANC in KZN will give the IFP a huge advantage  I like the fact that you think your sarcasm will give you votes whereas it actually promotes usihlalo wethu.
