Durban — The eThekwini Municipality health unit has been given the go-ahead to publish the municipal food, milk and milk products by-law 2022 for public participation. A report before the eThekwini full council on Thursday stated that the by-law was aimed at ensuring that measures are put in place to manage, control, minimise or eliminate municipal health nuisances, and the prohibition of certain activities or conduct to promote a healthy and safe environment within the eThekwini municipal area. The by-law is aimed at ensuring that food products are suitable for human consumption, and that their preparation is in compliance with the regulations applicable for food, milk and milk products. Also, Toyota SA has approached the health unit for input and/or feedback on a digital mobile vehicle designed to improve health care services in rural communities. It will be used on a trial basis, for a period of one year. The areas identified for the trial are Tafelkop and Madundube in ward 100. Toyota SA intends to donate the vehicle to the unit following the trial period between April 2022 and April 30, 2023. The outreach mobile vehicle has been developed with advanced technology that will enable municipal employees to perform their duties despite the current prevailing conditions of the terrain in rural areas.
