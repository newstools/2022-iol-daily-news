Durban — A private investigator has reported that Brendyn Mark Findlay was arrested in Mozambique for being in possession of fraudulent documents. Brad Nathanson took to his Facebook page, Brad Nathanson Investigations, and wrote that after ducking South African authorities, Findlay was arrested in Mozambique for being in possession of fraudulently manufactured documents to support his stay in that country as William Farmery. “Findlay was already under surveillance by Mozambique authorities in another matter,” Nathanson said. “Findlay, who has featured on our pages before, has been dubbed the “Tinder Swindler” of South Africa.” “If you are looking for him, you now know where to find him,” continued Nathanson. Commenting on the post, Charlton Charles Aubrey said: “This arrest was part of our ongoing investigation and tracing through our sources, special thanks to Roy Vermaak and his team at Nerita Solutions in Mozambique who assisted us with this matter and making the arrest. We are currently in the process of getting him brought back to SA with the help of immigration, SAPS and SA Correctional Services.” Lisa Rech Coetzee said she knew Findlay personally. He stole from her too. Coetzee asked if he was not wanted at Parow police station for robbery. In November 2018, Nathanson warned Pretoria residents to beware. He said it was good news for the Cape and surrounding areas, Findlay was no longer going to be a problem for them. However, it meant bad news for Pretoria and surrounding areas because Findlay was in their area. “Brendyn Mark Findlay is using the name Marco Ferreria and has arrived to ply his fraud trade in Pretoria where he hoped to be “under the radar” by using an assumed name. He is still selling invisible advertising space. He previously used the business name ‘Tygerberg Biz Online’'. “Beware this man. Don’t trust him with your wife, your wallet or your heart,” Nathanson said in 2018. Daily News
