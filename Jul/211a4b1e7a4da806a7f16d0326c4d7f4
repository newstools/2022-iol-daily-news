Durban – The City of uMhlathuze has started the process to increase potable water supply to Esikhaleni residents. It said as part of the project, it was replacing a 400m length of the 600 mm water pipe. The work started on Wednesday.  The City said that this would help increase water supply to 14 wards in the Esikhaleni cluster which have constantly been experiencing water cuts and shortages. It said areas in the cluster affected by the shortages include Esikhaleni Ward 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17,18,19, 20, 21, 22, 30 and 34,  Mkhwanazi Traditional Authority and Dube Traditional Authority.  “Water supply to these areas has been severely unstable since the beginning of April 2022 due to numerous power failures and continuous major burst pipes. This problem started in 2016 during the drought period. However, it got worse after the floods.” Mayor Xolani Ngwezi said that this work would bring some sense of relief to most affected residents.  “The installation and replacement of this pipe is expected to take between a week and three weeks and after the completion our residents will get a huge water relief. We are anticipating the completion of a 15-megalitre package plant in December, which will bring to end all water challenges in every ward of our city.” The package plant project will add water supply in 15 wards of eSikhaleni, Dlangezwa, Felixton, Niwe and surrounding areas.
