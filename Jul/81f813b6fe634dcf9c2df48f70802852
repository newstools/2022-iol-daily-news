Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC, Nonhlanhla Khoza will tomorrow attend a court case of a police officer who allegedly shot and killed his wife. The department said in a statement that it was alleged that the police officer shot his wife Thobeka Nene, 41, at their home in Ntshanga township, west of Durban, two weeks ago. Nene was a teacher at a local primary school, while the 44-year-old police officer is stationed at the local police station. It is alleged that Nene was shot dead after an argument between the couple. The department said MEC Khoza will join a massive protest outside Camperdown Magistrate’s Court led by residents from the community and social workers from eThekwini and Umgungundlovu Districts. “As women, we need to stand together to urge our courts to deny bail for this officer involved in gender-based violence.  “It is very sad that women are murdered daily. It is strange that women are killed by those who are supposed to protect them. Nene is now dead and her children are without their mother,” she said. MEC Khoza said it was time those involved in any form of abuse got isolated by society. THE MERCURY
