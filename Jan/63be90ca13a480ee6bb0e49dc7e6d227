WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE BELOW DURBAN - The National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) is investigating the illegal maiming of a stray dog’s ears in the North West. In a Facebook post, the NSPCA said in December 2021 that the Vryburg Dierehospitaal received a stray dog whose ears had been severely maimed. “Dr Carmen Nel, a veterinarian at the clinic, immediately called the NSPCA to report the stray dog and the fact that his ears had been ‘battle cropped’ – ears are removed so that in a dog fight, the other dog has less to grab onto,” the NSPCA said. The dog, now referred to as Tyson, found his way into the hearts of Nel and the rest of the clinic staff. Nel dedicated her time and effort into helping Tyson heal and recover from the abuse which nearly cost him his hearing. The NSPCA said Tyson’s ears were operated on, to save his hearing, he was sterilised and he was vaccinated. “The case is still under investigation by the NSPCA with regards to the fact that Tyson was maimed, which is illegal,” the NSPCA said. “The surgical mutilation of animals for any purpose other than overriding medical reasons is illegal in terms of the Animals Protection Act no 71 of 1962, regardless of whether the person is a qualified veterinarian or not. “The NSPCA will not hesitate to initiate the prosecution of anyone who is found responsible for the maiming of any animal,” the NSPCA said. The organisation said that before the holidays, Tyson found a loving home with one of the clinic staff. He now has furry friends to play with every day, a warm bed to fall asleep in at night and family who will never again subject him to pain and suffering. The NSPCA commended Nel and all the staff involved with Tyson’s rescue and recovery at the clinic. This is a story of kind people who went the extra mile for an animal in need of help and gave him the chance to be a loving pet. Daily News
