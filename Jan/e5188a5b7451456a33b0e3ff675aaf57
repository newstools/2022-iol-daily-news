DURBAN - BEACHGOERS in eThekwini have been warned to respect the no-swimming at night rule. This comes after three drowning incidents at the Amanzimtoti and Ansteys beaches on Thursday evening. Grunter Gully Fishing Tribe’s Rishad Khan said there have seen numerous cases around the city where people are swept away by the tides at night. “People are not listening; we are urging them to take precautions and not get into the water after six in the evening. We are not saying people should not go to the beach, but at night there are no lifeguards who will be there to salvage a life. “So it is not safe to swim in the evening. This is not based on any time of the year; it is not safe at all to swim at night. There have been many cases of completely avoidable drownings. Please respect the rules,” said Khan. Last Thursday eThekwini Search and Rescue were called to a scene where a woman, reported to be in her 30s, was drowning at the Amanzimtoti Beach. The woman was rescued from the water and worked on by paramedics who could not resuscitate her. While on scene at Amanzimtoti, the team was called to a separate incident at Ansteys Beach where two men were in trouble. Search and Rescue was able to help one of the men, while the other could not be located. The following morning, eThekwini Metro Police and SAPS joined the search for the other man. SAPS spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the recovery of his body. “The body of Jabulani Makhanya, 31, was found floating in the shore break at Garvies beach.” Khan said even experienced fishermen stay as far away from the shoreline as possible in the evening, as the tide is normally strong. “On the evening of the drowning incidents, we were standing on the shore because of the possibility of a high tide that could draw you into the water at any given moment. Keep away from the sea in the evening, especially after consuming alcohol.” Daily News
