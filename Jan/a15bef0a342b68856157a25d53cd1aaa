DURBAN - President Cyril Ramaphosa's apparent launch of his CR22 campaign ahead of the January 8 rally in Limpopo appeared to have angered some branches in KwaZulu-Natal. Several branch leaders who spoke to the Daily News on Thursday said they had planned to go to the party's 110th birthday celebrations in Limpopo but their spirit was dampened by Ramaphosa whom they said was using the movement’s calendar event to launch his second-term campaign.  On Wednesday Sekhukhune regional leaders and two other regions endorsed the president’s second-term.  One branch leader in KZN, who declined to be named, said they decided to cancel their trip after hearing that Ramaphosa planned to use the January 8 rally to launch his campaign. He said that they decided instead to refocus their energies in preparation for regional conferences instead of attending the event. It would, they said, appear that those in attendance were supporting the president's second-term which was not true. "My branch and a couple of others here in the province did not attend the event because they had realised that the president would use it to launch his second term-campaign. This is an important event for the party which must be used to unite the organisation and consolidate branches for the 2024 general election. It cannot be used for personal gain," said one leader, who declined to be named. The ANC provincial spokesperson Nhlakanipho Ntombela said the party did not organise for any branches to go to the event because of Covid-19. Anyone who wanted to attend would have done so on his or her own accord. This year is expected to be tough for the party as the provinces conduct the legwork to hold their conferences in preparation for the national elective conference which is expected to be at end of the year. North West is expected to lead the way by holding its conference next month. Daily News
