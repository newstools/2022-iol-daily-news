Cape Town - In the story published on December 30 and headlined “UWC students reject Judge Erasmus as mediator after high court order”, we quoted students of the Hector Pieterson Residence who said they rejected the judge as mediator. The University of the Western Cape (UWC) has pointed out that mediation was under way and that none of the students quoted attended mediation. Some students were also quoted as giving their views of the judge which UWC has indicated were untrue. The article in question is being withdrawn, and we apologise to UWC and Judge Erasmus for inconvenience caused. Cape Argus
