DURBAN - A child’s knowledge of the role of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) helped save a goat from drowning in a man-made ravine in a township far west of Durban. A Kloof and Highway SPCA field officer, Doctor Mthombeni, happened to be at the right place at the right time during the incident. Mthombeni was driving through Hammarsdale to collect a sick dog when he noticed a child running after his vehicle. He immediately stopped his vehicle and got out to speak to the child who said he had seen him driving past and that one of his goats was stuck in a deep muddy hole. The SPCA said Mthombeni and the child quickly drove to the area where the goat had fallen into a deep man-made ravine filled with mud and thick sludge. “Field officer Doctor immediately went to help the weak goat. He knew that he only had minutes to spare when he managed to rescue the goat from the deep ravine,” the SPCA said. “Both the field officer Doctor and the goat were exhausted and relieved. The goat was washed down and cleaned, so that it could be checked for any injuries.” The SPCA said the happy child and his goat were reunited with their families. The SPCA thanked Mthombeni for always being ready to help any animal needing to be rescued. “You deal with any situation with positivity and always show compassion and love for all animals, big or small,” the SPCA said to Mthombeni.
