DURBAN - Inkosi Phathisizwe Chiliza, the chairperson of the House of Traditional Leaders said the July unrest and riots that took place in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng were an expression of frustration as the government continued to dishonour its commitment to deliver services to communities. Speaking on Wednesday during a meeting at the Public Protector’s office in Durban, Inkosi Chiliza stated his disappointment with the isolation of traditional authority in programmes directly affecting communities. Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane met the Amakhosi as part of her office’s initiative to improve working relations between the traditional authority and the government. Chiliza said that building traditional chambers and providing resources for the traditional council would ensure good relations and ease the pressure with service delivery. “The royal house has no budget in KwaZulu-Natal, the Amakhosi are isolated and not consulted on issues affecting our people, which is something we need to bring to the attention of the public protector so that Cooperative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs department can also be roped in. “The July unrest did not happen out of the blue. Such things have the potential of happening if we are not united in leading our communities.” Daily News
