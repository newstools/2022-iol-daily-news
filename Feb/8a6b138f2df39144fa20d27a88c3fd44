DURBAN - In what appeared to be a campaign kick-off for the top leadership positions of the ANC, more than a hundred religious and traditional leaders descended on Pietermaritzburg, KZN, on Thursday to pray and lend their support for the ANC NEC member and former Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize. The ruling party’s 55th national elective conference is set to take place later this year, where various senior leaders of the ANC will lock horns in the battle to be part of the highly respected top six positions. The holy men and the traditional leaders urged Mkhize to help the country ‘breathe’ and avail himself to contest for the top position in the ANC. KwaNdwalane traditional leader, Inkosi Sazi Nelson Ndwalane, said the time has come for pastors to have a conversation about Mkhize helping them breathe as they were all suffocated and unable to express their frustrations. “Even the churches and schools must discuss how Mkhize will build conducive a space for everyone to breathe. Pastors must tell their church members that Mkhize can help the nation breathe as we move towards 2024. “As we have these conversations, we must encourage branches of the ANC to engage the people and not get into the factions of the ANC, so that people are consulted on the question of 2024 general elections when the nation will decide on who must take us forward, so we can all breathe,” said Inkosi Ndwalane. The pastors endorsed Mkhize as their next leader of the nation and urged him to focus on his journey to lead the nation. Mkhize’s bid for the position of ANC president places him among some of his comrades in the ANC NEC, including tourism minister Lindiwe Sisulu, Justice minister Ronald Lamola, Treasurer General of the ANC Paul Mashatile, and President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is reportedly seeking a second term.
