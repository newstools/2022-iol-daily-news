DURBAN businessman Suman Panday had fraud charges provisionally withdrawn against him in the Kempton Park Regional Court this week. Panday, 43, the chief executive at Blakey Plastics, and his co-accused, Madikana Gerald Mapokgola, 32, a stock clerk at Day Break Farm in Centurion, were arrested by Serious Organised Crime Investigation in Pretoria during an operation at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park in October 2020. The charges of fraud and corruption were withdrawn against them. Gauteng police spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said the men were accused of enticing a chicken farm employee with a R60 000 gratification. Mulamu alleged that Panday and Mapokgola approached an employee from Olifantsfontein chicken farm to influence the awarding of a tender to Blakey Plastics towards supplying chicken plastic wraps with a promise of a once-off R60 000 gratification and a monthly allowance. The employee reported the matter to the Hawks which led to their arrest. Panday was granted bail of R150 000, while Mapokgola was granted bail of R3 000, according to Mulamu. Panday said he was not related to KwaZulu-Natal businessman Thoshan Panday. A statement from Panday’s legal team, Singh and Associates Attorneys, read: “Panday, the CEO of Blakey Plastics, was ecstatic to announce that charges against him and his co-accused were withdrawn in the Kempton Park Regional Court. “Panday maintained his innocence throughout the long-drawn-out remands at court. Panday was of the firm belief that ‘justice will prevail and that the charges will be unfounded and without merit’. “Panday is now exhilarated to be a free man, he can now continue to uphold his business and business ethics with pride, integrity and good morals. Panday is ready to continue to take the business world by storm.” National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said she was awaiting information from the chief prosecutor of East Rand before she could comment.
