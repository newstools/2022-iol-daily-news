DURBAN – The KwaDukuza Local Municipality executive committee has approved its 2022 Dress A Child campaign. The approval was made during an executive committee meeting during the week. The campaign is a bid to address the inequities and stigma in the learning environment. This year, the council is celebrating a decade since the inception of the annual back-to-school dress a child campaign. The campaign was an annual programme that was established in 2021 to address the issue of inequality in the schooling environment. This year, the council would be supporting 320 pupils. KwaDukuza mayor Lindile Nhaca said: “We will also provide uniform vouchers to 50 high school pupils, targeting schools that are most in need. As a municipality, we continue to play an exemplary role in the iLembe region in supporting the education institution. “This is a giant leap forward as we up-scale the number of beneficiaries. This will go a long way at ensuring that our young children come to school less worried about their uniform as this just exerts unnecessary pressure which affects their livelihoods and performance.” Daily News
