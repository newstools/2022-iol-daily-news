DURBAN - An oThongathi tow truck owner was arrested twice in a few days for allegedly being in possession of drugs. Roshan Kalicharan, 42, was arrested on January 31 for allegedly being in possession of a variety of street drugs. Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the accused made his first appearance at the Verulam Magistrate’s Court and his case was remanded to last Friday. Kalicharan was released on R3 000 bail. Mbele said that on Tuesday, police officers from Tongaat SAPS acted on information about drug dealing taking place at Gardenia Crescent in Westbrook, oThongathi. She said police went to the said address and found a 42-year-old man. “He was searched and found with 36 pieces of rock cocaine. The suspect was immediately placed under arrest for possession of drugs.” Kalicharan appeared in court on Wednesday, and was remanded into police custody for further investigation. Mbele said police remain determined to eradicate the drug trade in the province and they were working with multiple role-players, from NGOs to government departments, to bring down drug dealers as well as the worrying phenomenon of teenagers turning to drug abuse and crime. “It’s very critical for parents to be more involved in the education of their children so that they are not exposed to those that peddle drugs. “We are encouraged by communities that are working through community police forums and other structures together with police, to bring down drug dealers and ensure that our youth are kept gainfully occupied so that they do not succumb to the temptation of drugs.” Mbele said drug abuse is an international problem and “we can learn lessons from other parts of the country and the world” where communities have successfully created drug-free zones and stemmed the culture of drug abuse. Mbele said drug dealers thrive in areas where there is a demand for their product. Daily News
