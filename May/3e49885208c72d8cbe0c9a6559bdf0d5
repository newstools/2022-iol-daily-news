Durban – The living conditions have worsened for the Quarry Road informal dwellers, in Reservoir Hills, after the weekend’s heavy rainfall which came while they were trying to rebuild after April’s floods. The desperate families are pleading for an urgent relief after many of their make-shift homes were washed away while others have lost their possessions. Following the floods, a bridge adjacent to the informal settlement and the M19 collapsed, resulting in water gushing into the area.  A larger than usual river runs through the dwelling, raising many safety concerns for community members who are calling for support. In an interview with the Sunday Tribune, one affected community member, Sindisiwe Ximba, says she lives in fear, and the slightest indication of rain leaves her anxious. “When the weather changes, we get so frightened because of what we experienced first during the April floods and then the rainfall over the weekend.  “We desperately need help as not everyone can be moved to alternate accommodation in the area or live with family and friends.  “I don’t know what to do, I don’t even know what I’m waiting for but I’m hoping someone comes to help us long term by giving us homes to live in. “I have lived here since 2003, we need help urgently.  “We lost everything, even our clothes are gone.  “Our children don’t even school uniforms.” Community leader, Phumi Mzizi, said she has sleepless nights since the floods, “people’s homes were washed away, about 50 homes and suddenly the river expanded because of the bridge collapsing and water gushing into the informal settlement. “We are afraid for our children as these are very dangerous living conditions.  “Our councillor and others have helped us, but we are in dire need.” SUNDAY TRIBUNE
