THEO JEPTHA “I have been living in Umdloti for 25 years. This is the second time the floods damaged the area. When I saw the weather forecasts, I was apprehensive because I didn’t realise what the repercussions would be and what the full outcome would be.“ “It is pretty devastating. Two roads in my area have been washed away. We are using bypasses. We are not cut off, that is the main thing. It would take a year to repair damages in the area.“ “I never experienced anything like this in the United Kingdom. We had plenty of rain but none of the destruction. It is such a pity for those affected.“ “For those who lost their houses, it’s an absolute disaster.“  “What happened here is very strange to me because we had the floods last month.” “I am a building contractor in the area that is moving all the sand from the roads and affected areas. I have been working here for many years and we never had problems like this. Since construction began on a housing project above the affected area, it has caused most of the damages here.” “It is sad to see what is happening and to see people suffer. The residents will wait for the municipality to assess the repairs and for compensation.” “Residents are also angry and frustrated.“  “I was worried when I saw the weather warnings again. It was quite bad last month. It is a hellavu lot worse now.“ “I am trying to unblock my driveway which was destroyed by sand.“ “I have been living here for 28 years and this is the first time this has happened.“  “I am a trader near Umdloti beach. We had difficulties accessing part of the area. I could not get my stock out of the area.” “We hoped to get across the damaged bridge to fetch our stuff. This storm was worse. It was a second warning. People took it lightly and the storm took us by surprise. We must be best prepared for any disaster that comes.“ Daily News
