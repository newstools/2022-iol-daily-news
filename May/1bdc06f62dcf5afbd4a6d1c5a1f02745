Durban - The computer laboratory at Centenary High School in Asherville, Durban received a R600 000 upgrade thanks to the South African Muslim Charitable Trust. School principal Douglas Gounden said the upgrade will better prepare pupils studying Information and Technology in keeping with the 4th Industrial Revolution and the 2030 vision of the Department of Education. The upgrade included the school’s computer laboratory, library, ablution facilities and windows. Speaking on behalf of the trust, Gaf Osman said the school had not benefited from any major infrastructure changes over the years. He said the costs of much-needed upgrades had proved beyond the financial means of a school whose staff displayed exceptional commitment to doing their level best for the pupils in their charge, regardless of the difficult conditions in which they operated. “The school’s teaching staff provide free intervention classes on weekdays, weekends, and during school holidays for the benefit of learners. “In addition, and in spite of the challenges it faces, the school has gone one step further in wanting to ensure that its learners may be exposed to a fully-functional library facility while also looking to provide Information Technology as a subject,” Osman said. “The tragedy is that like so many schools, under-resourcing and low levels of ability to pay school fees have placed a heavy financial burden on Centenary Secondary School.” He said it was vital to ensure pupils were exposed to books and computers and recognising that decent infrastructure was vital to effective teaching and learning. Osman said the financial contribution had made a difference to the most concerning elements of infrastructure: the upgrade of the doors and windows and a complete make-over of old toilet facilities, as well as a library upgrade. The school celebrated its 62th anniversary this year, while the trust, founded in 2008, funds schools across the country. Daily News
